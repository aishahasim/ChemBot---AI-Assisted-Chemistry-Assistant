# ChemBot---A Context-Aware Chemistry Research Assistant
ChemBot is a context-aware chemistry assistant powered by BioGPT + LangChain. We use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, where relevant document chunks are retrieved from FAISS and fed into BioGPT to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
